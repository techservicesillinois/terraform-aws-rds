[![Terraform actions status](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-rds/workflows/terraform/badge.svg)](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-rds/actions)

Provide an [RDS database instance](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/db_instance.html).

Use the [terraform-aws-client-server-security-group](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-client-server-security-group) module to create security groups
to be used by clients and servers of this RDS instance. The referred-to module
creates two RDS security groups â€“ one a client security group, and the other a
server security group.
The server security group should be referenced in the `security_group_names`
attribute when building an RDS instance.
The client security group should be added to authorized clients. and one
Members of the client security group are granted access to the RDS servers on
the appropriate network port.

**NOTE:** The `deletion_protection` attribute is `true` by default in order to make it
difficult to unintentionally destroy a persistent resource. To enable destruction, you
must set the attribute to `false` and then apply this change using Terraform.

Once applied, you can then run `terraform destroy` to destroy the database, which
includes destroying daily snapshots. **If you do not make a final snapshot, your
data will be irrevocably lost.**

## Usage

```hcl
module "db" {
  source = "git@github.com:techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-rds"

  # Identifier for RDS instance.
  identifier = "service"

  # Name of database.
  db_name   = "service-db"

  # Master user name. Password is automatically generated and should
  # be IMMEDIATELY reset via the AWS console or CLI.
  #
  # NOTE: Initial password may show up in logs, and is stored in
  # the Terraform state file.
  username = "foobar"
  port     = 5432

  # Database engine details. The engine_version must be consistent
  # with family and option_group_name settings in this file.
  engine         = "postgres"
  engine_version = "14.4"

  # Security group referenced below is created by the https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-client-server-security-group module.
  security_group_names = "service-db-servers"

  # Don't use the following settings in production!
  # apply_immediately           = true
  # allow_major_version_upgrade = true

  # Instance class and storage in gigabytes.
  instance_class    = "db.t2.medium"
  allocated_storage = 100

  # Automatically apply minor version upgrades during maintenance window.
  auto_minor_version_upgrade = true

  # Save backups for this many days.
  backup_retention_period = 7

  # Deploy in multiple availability zones.
  multi_az           = false

  # Backup window is expressed in UTC. Must not overlap with maintenance window.
  backup_window      = "07:00-10:00"

  # Maintenance window is expressed in UTC. Must not overlap with backup window.
  maintenance_window = "Sun:04:00-Sun:07:00"

  # When set to `true`, deleting the database instance using the API or
  # Terraform is prohibited. In order to delete the database (and snapshots),
  # this setting must be changed to false, either using Terraform
  # or the AWS console.
  deletion_protection = true

  # If specified, use specified snapshot for initial database build.
  # snapshot_identifier = "service-FINAL"

  ###########################################################################
  # WARNING: Use caution; setting this value to true can cause data loss.   #
  ###########################################################################
  skip_final_snapshot   = false

  # Final database snapshot is given this identifier by default.
  # final_snapshot_identifier = "service-FINAL"

  # Subnet must already exist.
  db_subnet_group_name = "develop-subnet-2"

  # THe option_group_name and parameter_group_name must already exist if
  # using non-default values.
  # option_group_name    = "default:postgres14"
  # parameter_group_name = "service.parameter-group"

  tags = {
    Name        = "service"
    Owner       = "user"
  }
