[![Terraform actions status](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-rds/workflows/terraform/badge.svg)](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-rds/actions)

Provide an [RDS database instance](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/db_instance.html).

Use the [terraform-aws-client-server-security-group](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-client-server-security-group) module to create security groups
to be used by clients and servers of this RDS instance. The referred-to module
creates two RDS security groups â€“ one a client security group, and the other a
server security group.
The server security group should be referenced in the `security_group_names`
attribute when building an RDS instance.
The client security group should be added to authorized clients. and one
Members of the client security group are granted access to the RDS servers on
the appropriate network port.

**NOTE:** The `deletion_protection` attribute is `true` by default in order to make it
difficult to unintentionally destroy a persistent resource. To enable destruction, you
must set the attribute to `false` and then apply this change using Terraform.

Once applied, you can then run `terraform destroy` to destroy the database, which
includes destroying daily snapshots. **If you do not make a final snapshot, your
data will be irrevocably lost.**

## Usage

```hcl
module "db" {
  source = "git@github.com:techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-rds"

# Identifier for RDS instance.
identifier = "service"

# Security group referenced below is created by the https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-client-server-security-group module.
security_group_names = "service-db-servers"

# Name of database to be created.
name     = "service-db"

# NOTE: Terraform-specified password is used to bring up infrastructure,
# but is insecure because it's stored in the infrastructure state file.
# We recommend changing password IMMEDIATELY to new value using AWS console,
# and saving that password as a secure parameter in Amazon SSM.

# User name and password.
username = "user"
password = "password"
port     = 1521

# Database engine details. Note that version needs to be consistent
# with family and option_group_name settings in this file.
engine         = "oracle-ee"
engine_version = "12.1.0.2.v11"

# Don't use the following settings in production!
# apply_immediately = true
# allow_major_version_upgrade = true

# Instance class and storage in gigabytes.
instance_class    = "db.t2.medium"
allocated_storage = 100

# Automatically apply minor version upgrades during maintenance window.
auto_minor_version_upgrade = true

# Save backups for this many days.
backup_retention_period = 7

# Deploy in multiple availability zones.
multi_az           = false

# Backup window is expressed in UTC. Must not overlap with maintenance window.
backup_window      = "07:00-10:00"

# Maintenance window is expressed in UTC. Must not overlap with backup window.
maintenance_window = "Sun:04:00-Sun:07:00"

# When set to `true`, deleting the database instance using the API or
# Terraform is prohibited. In order to delete the database (and snapshots),
# this setting must be changed to false, either using Terraform
# or the AWS console.
deletion_protection = true

# If specified, use snapshot for initial database build.
# snapshot_identifier = "service-snapshot"

###########################################################################
# WARNING: Use caution; setting this value to true can cause data loss. #
###########################################################################
skip_final_snapshot = false

# Final database snapshot is given this identifier by default.
# final_snapshot_identifier = "service-FINAL"

# Subnet, parameter, and option group resources must already exist.
db_subnet_group_name = "develop-subnet-2"
parameter_group_name = "service-pg"
# Note that RDS manages default option group.
option_group_name    = "default:oracle-ee-12-1"

tags = {
  Environment = "test"
  Name        = "service"
  Owner       = "user"
}

|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| allocated_storage | The allocated storage in gigabytes | string | - | yes |
| allow_major_version_upgrade | Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible | string | `false` | no |

| auto_minor_version_upgrade | Indicates that minor engine upgrades will be applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window | bool | `true` | no |
| availability_zone | The Availability Zone of the RDS instance | string | `` | no |
| backup_retention_period | The days to retain backups for | number | `1` | no |
| backup_window | The daily time range (in UTC) during which automated backups are created if they are enabled. Example: '09:46-10:16'. Must not overlap with maintenance_window | string | - | yes |
